# The philosophy of Camp Songs
1. tune - usually a commonly known melody
2. lyrics (verbal components) - words people say/sing/shout
3. motions (somatic components) - actions people take with their body
4. props (material components) - items used in delivering the song
5. twist - the thing that makes it interesting
