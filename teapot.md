# I'm a little teapot
1. tune - We Will Rock You by Queen 
2. lyrics
  * Verse
    * I'm a little teapot short and stout
    * Here is my handle, here is my spout
    * When I get all steamed up hear me shout
    * Tip me over and pour me out!
  * Chorus
    * I'm a little teapot ... teapot
    * I'm a little teapot ... teapot  
3. motions
  * Everyone does the stomp stomp clap intro from We Will Rock You the whole time.
4. props - none
5. twist - You don't tell them you're doing I'm a little teapot. You just start the stomp stomp clap. It can also be used if a crowd is idle and you want to grab attention (a la, the slow clap).
